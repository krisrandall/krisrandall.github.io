		<h2>What is datasync.js for?</h2>
		<p>
			datasync.js is for creating a web-client/mobile app which is able to 
			fetch data from, and store data to, a web server.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are obviously 2 components, a server DB and the client App.<br/>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Setting up the Server</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first step is to setup your (MySQL) database on the server </li>
				<li>Next put the <i>datasync-server</i> direcotry (PHP code) onto the server </li>
				<li>Set up the config for your DB and your client App in <i>datasync-server/config.php</i> </li>
			</ol>
			That's all that needs to be done on the server!
		</p>
		
		<h2>Setting up the Client</h2>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Add the <i>datasync-client</i> directory to your client app</li>
				<li>On the <b>server</b> run <i>datasync-server/generateClientJS.php</i>, and save
					the generated code as <i>datasync-client/mydb.js</i> </li>
				<li>Delete <i>datasync-server/generateClientJS.php</i> if you don't want everyone on the 
					internet to be able to see your data structure</li>
			</ol>	
			Now your client is setup!<br/>
			You can use datasync in your code:
			<pre>
							    
			    datasync.fetchFromServer(table, where, success, fail);
			    datasync.storeToServer(table, where, success, fail);

			</pre>
		</p>
		
		<h2>A full datasync.js example</h2>
		<p>
			TO DO ...	
			<br/>
			what we will do here is make a live demo DB - not accessable via any external
			mechanism, but we will show the tables here,
			and then include a download bundle which includes datasync and a demo app,
			actually, datasync.demo.html could be that demo app ....
			it could be a simple list the data from the server,
			and then we could do a really simple interface to update the data on the web too,
			so they can see the changes happen ....
			hmmmm.... but also not let them remove all data ... 
			perhaps it is better that the web data be via some kind of feed,
			even tweets that have the #datasync has tag mebe .. ??
			<br/>
		</p>
		
		<h2>Why not OData?</h2>
		<p>
			A good question.<br/>
			OData exists at the time of developing datasync.js, however it is not yet
			mature.
			For example there is not a read/write PHP/MySQL OData sever library 
			available yet and I am dis-inclinded to write one myself.
			In the future there is no reason why datasync.js could not be modified
			to use OData as it's protocol (and no change would even be required to
			the datasync.js API), but for now it uses it's own protocol.
